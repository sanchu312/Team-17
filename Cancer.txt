Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. 
Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. 
Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you dont need them, and old cells dont die when they should. 
These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. 
Tumors can be benign or malignant. 
Benign tumors arent cancer while malignant ones are. 
Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues.
They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.
Most cancers are named for where they start.
For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast.
 The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis.
 Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. 
 Treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy.
