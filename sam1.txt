A lower respiratory tract infection can affect the airways, such as with bronchitis, or the air sacs at the end of the airways, as in the case of pneumonia.
Symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections vary and depend on the severity of the infection.

Less severe infections can have symptoms similar to the common cold, including:

a stuffed up or a runny nose
a dry cough
a low fever
a mild sore throat
a dull headache

In more severe infections, symptoms can include:

a severe cough that may produce phlegm
fever
difficulty breathing
a blue tint to the skin
rapid breathing
chest pain
